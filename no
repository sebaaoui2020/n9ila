The blue stuffed bear is no Care Bear. When he opens his mouth, he has rows of sharp teeth. And that's just the tip of the iceberg Poppy Playtime is a game of survival set in an abandoned toy factory. Players must solve puzzles while Huggy Wuggy hunts them. He has inspired multiple YouTubers to create parodies of creepy songs, that, while not intended for children, are easy for kids to find and watch online. "
