This enables them to gain access to the security room, where one of the grab pack hands can be unlocked. Grab Packs can rewire electrical cables and unlock doors. Using this precise hand, the player eventually unlocks a door. Inside a circular area, they find a blue monster dubbed “Huggy Wuggy.” Although the gate does not open, this former employee tries to unlock a door with this hand. "

You take his keys and enter the Power Room through the Power Room entrance. They discover that the power is out and decide to wrap the arm of their grab pack around some generators while pressing the power button. The power is turned on inside the factory as a result of this. They walk into the next room and open the door (now that the power is working). On either side of the player, two doors emerge, one open and the other locked. The closest pipe (unexpectedly) bursts as we are led into this area by a hand. "

They climb two flights of stairs and discover four power cores gone, before jumping down into the factory’s conveyer belt. The person must search the entire chamber until all four of these cells are found, then open the door that they arrived through. The prior employee ensures that all four power cells are in position and that the claw is powered up as quickly as possible. This claw takes the box, drops it on the conveyer belt, and the player receives his second hand. "

(It’s merely a different wiring scheme.) This belt gets a boost of power and begins to move. This takes them to a chamber where they must power the gadget for the third time by wiring it. To make a toy, you must first activate the power, then press the button and pull all three levers. The toy is assembled, painted, and quality checked by this machine. You’ll be able to grasp this toy and place it into a small scanner quite quickly. The following room is quickly unlocked by the scanner. "

Slid down the metallic part of the vents by falling through the metal plate. Turn around and walk straight until you see a little aperture in the vents. Both of these times, crouch into the opening and turn right. "
